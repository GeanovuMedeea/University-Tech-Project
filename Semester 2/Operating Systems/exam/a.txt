oted to be the least violent among the Dragon Lords, being focused on accumulating wealth and securing his lands.
Apsu was described as being cool-headed, calm, open-minded and accepting, which had won over many Balaur
tribes which willingly joined him and supported him to be appointed as a Dragon Lord. Curiously, the Balaur are known for their arrogance and interest for self-gain,
 so this supportive behavior is quite unusual. He was remarkable not only for his excellent strategies that had won many battles against the Daevas, but also 
for his talent for diplomacy. He was also a powerful sorcerer.

His greatest flaw was his pride, which turned out to become the catalyst for his downfall. There are mentions that he suddenly refused to consider advice from 
his counselors, perhaps being excessively certain of his own ideas and principles. (â€œThere are indications that Apsu was an extremely proud creature, 
unwilling to compromise or entertain advice.")

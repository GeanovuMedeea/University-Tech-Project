--Karatsuba Formula--
x * y = z1 + z2 * x^m + z3 * x^2m
z1 = x0 * y0
z2 = x1 * y0 + x0 * y1
z3 = x1 * y1

x0, y0 - lower parts of the polynomials x and y (0 to middle)
x1, y1 - upper parts of the polynomials x and y (middle, to the length of the bigger polynomial)

--Synchronization mechanisms--
ExecutorService - Manages thread pool and task scheduling.Ensures efficient and safe execution of parallel tasks.
Future - Represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Blocks until the computation is completed, ensuring tasks are properly synchronized.
Task Isolation - Each thread works on separate, independent data (e.g., polynomial parts or coefficient ranges). Prevents race conditions by eliminating shared state dependencies.

--Time measurements--
The following shows the time of the execution in ms.
